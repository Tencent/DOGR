 ### Abstract 
 In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have increasingly emphasized grounding and referring capabilities to achieve detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, in the realm of visual document understanding, these capabilities lag behind due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the **DO**cument **G**rounding and **R**eferring data engine (**DOGR-Engine**), which produces two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: multi-granular parsing data for enhancing fundamental text localization and recognition capabilities; and instruction-tuning data to activate MLLM's grounding and referring capabilities during dialogue and reasoning. Additionally, using our engine, we construct **DOGR-Bench**, which encompasses 7 grounding and referring tasks across 3 document types (chart, poster, PDF document), providing comprehensive evaluations for fine-grained document understanding. Furthermore, leveraging the data generated by our engine, we develop a strong baseline model, **DOGR**. This pioneering MLLM is capable of accurately referring and grounding texts at multiple granularities within document images.
